/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

3) Install Jenkins on Ubuntu 24.04

sudo apt update
 sudo apt install jenkins -y
 systemctl status jenkinsTo view the password, use the cat command as shown:


 sudo systemctl start jenkins
 sudo ufw allow 8080
 
  sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
  
 In the next step, select ‘Install suggested plugin‘ for simplicity’s sake.
 
 When the installation of plugins is complete, the installer will take you to the next section where you will be required to create an Admin user and click on the ‘Save and Continue’ button.
 The next step will populate the default URL for your Jenkin’s instance. No action is required, simply click ‘Save and Finish’.
 Finally, click on the ‘Start using Jenkins’ button to gain access to Jenkins dashboard.
